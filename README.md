# Management Portal
> A high school computer science project written in pure C++. <br>
The application provides an all-in-one solution for management of records of faculty and students of the organisation, reviewing faculty job applications and also providing access to the entire database for the admin.
 Students and faculty can view and edit their profiles after logging into their accounts and view their respective time tables for the week.

# Installation
> - Requires the ancient Turbo C++ compiler to run. 
> - Add main project file to `bin` directory and the `.h` files to the `include` directory  

<br>

## Note
Since the application was made with Turbo C++, the c++ syntax used is pretty much outdated and would definitely show errors with modern-day compilers.
